GeoCode.py
---------- 

Strictly speaking, this isn't iOS Objective-C code, although I do use this code somewhat frequently when developing on iOS.

It's a quick python script that geocodes addresses:

* Addresses are supplied in a file named **GeoCode.in**.

* Full JSON responses from Google are saved in a file named **GeoCode.out**. 

* Parsed output is written to console as its downloaded from Google.

UIDeviceHardware
----------------

There are times when it's useful to know exactly what sort of hardware your iOS app is running on. 

The UIDeviceHardware class uses low-level C APIs to discover exactly what version of iPod, iPhone
or iPad hardware your application is running on.
