Utilities
=========

GeoCode.py
---------- 

Technically speaking, this isn't iOS Objective-C code, but I do use this code rather frequently in my iOS work.

It's a quick python script that geocodes addresses. 

Addresses are supplied in a file named GeoCode.in.

Full JSON responses from Google are saved in a file named GeoCode.out. 

Parsed output is written to console as its downloaded from Google.

UIDeviceHardware
----------------

There are times when it's useful to know exactly what sort of hardware your iOS app is running on. 

The UIDeviceHardware class uses low-level C APIs to discover exactly what version of iPod, iPhone
or iPad hardware your application is running on.
